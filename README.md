# CampusCare
CampusCare is a modern web-based platform designed to streamline campus facility management and complaint handling. It enables students to easily file, track, and manage complaints related to infrastructure, utilities, and maintenance — while allowing administrators to monitor, assign, and resolve them efficiently.
